#Labeler
----
I needed some way of tagging words in an Excel spreadsheet of addresses so that I could have classified training data for my planned machine learning classifier.  I therefore wrote this little thing to import Excel (.xlsx) files, convert them to JSON (originally XML but I changed that, thought it should still function), an provide a way of labeling each word.
